With inspiration from [_Evolving AIs: Predator vs Prey_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwrp3lB-jkQ),
this project tries to reverse engineer the system as shown in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwrp3lB-jkQ).
While the implementation depends on `Math.random()`, machine learning (ai) algorithms and libraries
(such as [brain.js](https://brain.js.org/), [tensorflowjs](https://www.tensorflow.org/js), [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/)) are to be put to use to power the behaviourof the agents.
This follows addition of more characteristics that make it more like a real world scenario.
