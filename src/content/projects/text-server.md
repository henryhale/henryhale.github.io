![text-server](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b17dbff-d7cd-42c4-b5aa-18653fe84286)

This project aims at developing a self-hosted, web-based document editor with rich text editing and file management capabilities, packaged as a single executable.

Like [code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server) but delivering a WYSIWYG editor and file explorer only.

Why? I needed a local-first document editing tool in a single executable to allow me create, edit and manage my documents on the go. Basically privacy-focused by self hosting the tool or using it locally on a local area network.
