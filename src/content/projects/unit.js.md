Unit.js is a lightweight HTML-first UI static site generator designed to bring focus, simplicity, and enhanced developer productivity to your projects.
Powered by Vite, Unit.js encourages a streamlined development experience with a unique approach to components.

In a nutshell, you write reusable HTML components into a `.unit` file and import it into your entry `.unit` file or other components.
They can contain HTML, CSS, and JS. Just like components in React, Vue or Solid, you can pass props to fill placeholders in the child
components.
