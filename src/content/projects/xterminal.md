![XTerminal](https://github.com/henryhale/vix/raw/master/media/preview.png)

This library provides a simple, lightweight and perfomant solution for creating interactive web-based command-line interfaces (CLIs) with ease in your web applications. It aims to be a minimalist dependency-free alternative to popular libraries like [jquery.terminal](https://github.com/jcubic/jquery.terminal), offering improved performance and a simplified approach.

This project draws inspiration from the powerful [node:readline](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html) module in Node.js, which has proven to be a reliable and efficient tool for command-line interactions. Additionally, inspiration is derived from the versatility and functionality of [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs), a widely adopted library for web-based terminal emulators.

By combining the best features and ideas from these sources, this library aims to provide an accessible and performant solution for creating web-based CLIs that meet the needs of modern web applications.
