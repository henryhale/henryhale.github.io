![MDR](https://github.com/henryhale/mdr/raw/master/media/screenshot-2.png)

This project showcases a pattern recognition game inspired by the Apple TV+ series "Severance". Unlike the show's macro data refinement based on emotional response, this game focuses on logical deductions through mathematical patterns.

As someone who enjoys solving Sudoku puzzles, playing number games and exploring experimental ideas, MDR combines all those elements. The goal is to train your brain to detect hidden patterns in randomly generated datasets.
