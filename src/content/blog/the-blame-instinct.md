_The 9th Rule of Thumb - Resist pointing your finger. From GapMinder's book: [Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World – and Why Things Are Better Than You Think.](https://www.gapminder.org/factfulness/blame/)_

When unexpected outcomes occur, how often do we instinctively blame people or circumstances we dislike? Is it fair—or even logical—to assume they are the root cause of the problem?

Consider these common reactions:

- “I’m broke and can’t find a job—it must be the president’s or government's fault.”

- “Thank you, God, for my wealth and success!” — while overlooking the roles of privilege, opportunity, or effort.

- “Why should I learn calculus or history? It’s useless.” — yet we rely on technologies and systems built on such knowledge.

While there may be some truth to these assumptions—causality is complex, and small changes can ripple into larger effects (as seen in concepts like the [butterfly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect) or [domino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_effect) effect)—they often reflect a limited understanding of the situation.

This raises an important question: How would the outcome change if circumstances were different? What if the current president weren’t in office? What if someone were born into a different family, location, or economic class? Would the result truly be different, or are there deeper underlying factors at play?

The problem arises when we default to blame instead of considering the full picture. Often, our expectations are shaped by personal biases or past experiences, which can be misleading if our knowledge of the issue is incomplete. Blaming external factors may also serve as an excuse to avoid self-reflection. For example, a lack of income might not be due to the economy alone but also to one's unwillingness to seek opportunities, build skills, or take risks.

On the other hand, an open-minded approach acknowledges multiple possibilities—including personal responsibility. Instead of assigning blame impulsively, we should ask: What factors—both external and internal—truly contributed to this outcome? What could I do differently?

True understanding comes from questioning our assumptions, considering different perspectives, and recognizing that the world is rarely as simple as it seems.
