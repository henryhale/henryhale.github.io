The urge to make a sigh of relief after typing a vaguely crafted text prompt into ChatGPT then seat back and relax, waiting for this genie to do magical things only to realize magic is no magic but rather a collection of paraphrased words arranged to make complexity seem/feel simple.

While rolling eyes over this amazing typing animation with results; there you go.
A new group text, can't miss it.
Oh wait, I got it.
Let me see, do I know it now?
Opps, followed by frustration.
Hey wizard, show me some magic.
And there you go again typing that ice breaking prompt to fill the void within.

One, two, three blinks of an eye and it's four hours down.
Well, hunger is approaching.
Miracles happen just right when you least expected them.
A text ads or message or post saying, _"i am not alone, a little relaxation won't hurt."_

Oh shit, I haven't written this answer.
MetaAI gives short and precise answers, let me use this.
Man, I don't see that keyword.
ChatGPT really placed it well.
But they are both correct.
I don't know any better.
Should write MetaAI's answer, short and quick.

It was in this moment when I lost my soul 💀 seated next to a stranger.

Started asking myself question after question; one of which is: _where is this going?_
The search or desire for simplicity is enormous and forever expanding.

Reading wikis/docs/notes about the topic is crap for some.
In fact it seems like they are scared of the lone inner dialogue when reading the entire piece while keeping track of important information as well as articulating the implications from the text.
