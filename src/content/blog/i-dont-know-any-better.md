The urge to make a sigh of relief after typing a vaguely crafted text prompt into ChatGPT, then sit back and relax, waiting for this genie to do magical things - only to realize the magic is no magic at all, but rather a collection of paraphrased words arranged to make complexity seem simple.

While rolling eyes over this amazing typing animation with results, there it goes.
A new group text, can't miss it.
Oh wait, I got it.
Let me check.
Do I understand it now?
Nope.
Frustration follows.
Hey wizard, show me some real magic.
And there I go again typing that ice-breaking prompt to fill the void within.

One, two, three blinks of an eye and it's four hours down the drain.
Scrolling, prompting, re-prompting.
Well, hunger is approaching.
But miracles happen just right when you least expected them.
A text, an ad, a post saying, _"I am not alone. A little relaxation won't hurt."_

Oh shit, I haven't written this answer yet.
MetaAI gives short and precise answers, let me use that.
Wait, I don't see that keyword.
ChatGPT really placed it better.
But they are both correct.
I don't know any better.
Should write MetaAI's answer?
Short and quick.

It was in this moment when I lost my soul 💀 seated next to a stranger in the library, pretending to learn.

I started asking myself question after question, one of which was: _where is this going?_
The search for simplicity, the desire to avoid effort, is enormous and forever expanding.
Maybe I don't know any better either.
But I was certian, this was going nowhere.

Reading wikis, docs, notes about the topic feels like crap to some.
In fact, it seems like they're scared of the lone inner dialogue when reading the entire piece, keeping track of important information, and articulating the implications from the text.
