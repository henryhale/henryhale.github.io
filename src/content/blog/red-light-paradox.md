Have you ever wondered why we see red light as red? It seems like a simple
question, but the answer reveals not only a deep understanding of science but
also a fascinating paradox: the particles that make up red light aren't actually
red themselves. This concept isn't just a quirk of physics - it's a powerful
analogy that applies to many areas of life and science. Just as invisible
photons create the visible phenomenon of red light, many systems in our world
are composed of parts that don't resemble the whole they create. The rest of
this post tends to set common grounds first as well as attempt to answer the
question: `is water wet?` using the red light paradox.

## Across All Scales

Suppose that you have a digital image on your phone, when you zoom in, you can
concetrate your view on a specific area in detail. Just like
AppleMaps/GoogleMaps, tiny details on any one view tend to become a composition
on several tinnier components. (idea from Eric Weinsten on Steven's Podcast)

As human beings, we observe objects in nature. Zoom in, we are just a collection
of living cells, working together while drifting through space. At the cells
level, imagine a single cell to correspond to a human being in contrast to the
fact that a cell is a made up of atoms. It becomes clear that an object on Earth
can be observed at different scales to contain several components that become
tinier every level deeper. Like Fermi's Paradox, planet Earth is one planet
around one star in one galaxy in one universe. The size of a single atom is
rationally close to unimaginable on large scales/sizes such as planets or
galaxies. It keep me up wondering if everything is large or small.

However, across all scales, most if not all characteristics/properties/aspects
of an object fade when focus shifts to a single component that is part of what
makes the object. Since we have only two eyes on the human scale level, we are
bound to observe objects within the limits of this level. Yes, we can extend our
view to smaller/larger scales with special equipments like telescopes or
microscopes.

Now that you can picture the world across different scales, it is time to delve
into the red light paradox.

## The Science Behind the Analogy

The true nature of light is an interestingly subtle topic in physics. Why red
light? Why not green or blue? Well, it's the same: blue light is not made up of
blue particles. To understand this paradox, we need to look into the nature of
light itself. Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation that travels in
waves. Different colors of light correspond to differenct wavelengths on this
electromagnetic spectrum.

Red light, which we percieve as the color red, has a wavelength of approximately
620-750 nanometers. But here's where it gets interesting: light is also composed
of particles called photons. As discussed in the wave-particle duality theory,
these photons are the fundamental units of light. They don't have any color
property themselves. Instead, their energy level determines the wavelength of
light they produce.

Our perception of color comes from how our eyes and brain intercept these
different wavelengths. When photons with the energy level corresponding to red
light hit the photoreceptors in our eyes, our brains interprets this as the
color red. The "redness" of red light is more about our perception than an
intrinsic property of the photons themselves.

## Some Key Examples in Different Fields

This concept of parts not resembling the whole they create extends far beyond
light and colr. Let's explore some interesting examples from various fields:

- **Pixels in Digital Images**: Just as photons create the illusion of red
  light, individual pixels create the illusion of a complete image. A single
  pixel doesn't contain a miniature version of the picture - it is just a tiny
  dot of color. It's only when thousands or millions of these pixels are
  arranged together that we percieve a coherent image.

- **Atoms in Materials**: Consider a gold ring. While the ring is shiny and
  golden, the idividual atoms that make it up are neither shiny nor
  gold-colored. The properties we associate with gold emerge from the
  collective behavior of countless atoms arranged in a specific crystal
  structure.
- **Notes in Music**: A beautiful melody isn't contained within in any single
  note. Rather, it emerges from the arrangement and timing of multiple notes.
  Just as red light requires photons of a specific energy, a melody requires
  notes played in a specific energy, a melody requires notes played in a
  specific sequence and rhythm.
- **Genes in Traits**: Complex traits in living organismis, like height or
  intelligence, aren't determined by single genes. Instead, they result from
  the intricate interplay of multiple genes and environmental factors. No
  single gene contains the blueprint for these complex characteristics.
- **Team Members in Sports**: In team sports, like soccer or basket ball,
  victory isn't acheived by any single player, no matter how talented. Success
  emerges from the collective effort, strategy, and syngery of the entire team
  working together - much like how the perception of red light emerges from
  the collective behavior of photons.

From the above examples, it's clear that there exists several different areas,
cases, or scenarios where the analogy could be applied. In summary;

- **Money**: Dollar bills aren't inherently valuable; their worth is assigned.
- **Words**: Letter in words don't carry meaning individually; meaning emerges
  from their combination.
- **Neurons**: Individual nuerons don't contain thoughts; it's thier
  collective activity.
- **Social media likes**: A single "like" doesn't indicate true popularity;
  it's the aggregate.
- **Ingredients**: Individual ingredients don't represent the final dish's
  flavor.
- **Data ponts**: A single data point doesn't reveal a trend; it's the overall
  pattern.
- **Computer code**: Single lines of code don't make a program; it's their
  collective function.
- **Puzzle pieces**: One piece doesn't show the full picture; it's how they
  fit together.
- **Chemical elements**: Individual elements in a compound don't exhibit the
  compound's properties.

Before we look into the founding question of this post, a clear understanding of
the implications of this paradox is a must-have to reach an answer.

## The Philosophical Implications

This "Red Light Paradox" challenges our intuitive understanding of the world.
It's a prime example of emergence - the idea that complex systems and patterns
arise from relatively simple interactions. This concept stands in contrast to
reductionism, which attempts to explainf complex phenomena by breaking them down
into simpler parts.

The paradox invites us to adopt a more holistic view of the world. Just as we
can't understand the nature of red light by examining a single photon, we often
can't understand complex systems by studying their components in isolation. This
perspective can lead to profound insights in fields ranging from biology to
sociology to artificial intelligence.

## Is Water Wet?

Well, some many people have approached this in several fascinating ways that
fill their conscience. I am not any different and this is my view:

- Water wets other surfaces. A single water molecule doesn't wet a surface, it's the
  collective effect of many. I argue that water is not wet and that `wetting`
  is as a result of action of water on something solid. Molecules in water are
  not layered up like bricks so it is wrong to say: A water molecule on top of
  another does not imply that the former molecule wets the latter.

## Conclusion

From the photons creating red light to the pixels forming digital images, from
atoms in materials to notes in music, the world is full of examples where the
whole is greater than and different from the sum of its parts. This paradox
serves as reminder of the complexity and interconnectedness of our world.
Personally, nothing knocks me out like learning about the details of a
technology from whole to bits for example how computer graphics boils down to
manipulating pixels on a 2d grid. At this point, how might the red light paradox
change the way you approach complex problems or systems?
