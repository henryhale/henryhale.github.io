Water wets other surfaces.

A water molecules doesn't wet a surface, it's the collective effect of many.

I think that water is not wet. I think `wetting` is as a result of action of water on something solid. 

We know that particles in red light are not red themselves.

Molecules in water are not layered up like bricks so it is wrong to say: A water molecule on top of another implies that the former molecule wets the latter.

>Most scientists define wetness as a liquid's ability to maintain contact with a solid surface, meaning that water itself is not wet, but can make other sensation. But if you define wet as 'made of liquid or moisture', as some do, then water and all other liquids can be considered wet.
